### Golden-Eagle

- We have subdivided the face recognition system.

‚Äª Change_history: [2025/07/14]üÜô

#### Getting started

```markdown
The lower the accuracy, the greater the possibility that it is the same person.
```

‚Äª The accuracy will never be 0 even for the same photo.

> I did a face comparison based on the resume photos used in job hunting for people in their 20s to early 40s. 

> If the accuracy was not kept below 0.31, the results would look like someone else's face,

> even if it was my own face. However, this is my personal opinion.

#### v1.0.2

~~This image is of the person himself. (v1.0.0 ~ v1.0.1)~~

> Contents of the output message after face recognition comparison.

‚Äª To avoid confusion, I changed it to ‚≠ïÔ∏è‚ùéÔ∏è.

#### v1.0.3

```markdown
Which face detection model to use.
‚Äúhog‚Äù is less accurate but faster on CPUs.
‚Äúcnn‚Äù is a more accurate deep-learning model,
which is GPU/CUDA accelerated (if available).
The default is ‚Äúhog‚Äù.
```

```python
...
# The default is ‚Äúhog‚Äù.
lo_before = face_recognition.face_locations(my_before, model='cnn')
lo_after = face_recognition.face_locations(my_after, model='cnn')
...
```

#### ChangeLog: 2025/07/07(‰∏ÉÂ§ï), v1.0.4

> The functions have been separated.

#### v1.0.5 ~ v1.0.5.1

- Accuracy evaluation: An exception will be thrown if the accuracy is greater than 0.32.

- print debug, ‚≠ïÔ∏è‚ùéÔ∏è has been removed.

- Resolve, Dependent libraries during installation.

- The internal structure has been refactored.

‚Äª Please use this library to evaluate the accuracy of facial photos and ensure their reliability.

> If it doesn't work, please fix the python code yourself.

‚Äª Tested, run.py on WSL2. (check: v1.0.0 ~ v1.0.5.1)

#### v1.0.5.1 (Leave it in place)

```markdown
It can be used for unit testing.
Purpose, You can check if the person working on it is the same person.
```

> unit/facecompare.py

```python
import face_recognition
import golden_eagle as ga
import gc
import os
import threading


# face class
class Face(threading.Thread):

    # use thread
    def __init__(self):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)

    # run method
    def run(self):
        # Windows Env.
        if os.path.exists(os.path.expanduser('~/images/')):
            # My Face picture in images folder.
            my_before = face_recognition.load_image_file(
                os.path.expanduser('~/images/myself.gif'))
            my_after = face_recognition.load_image_file(

        # Image Folder not found.
        else:
            raise ValueError("None, Please Check the Image Folder")

        # golden-eagle version.
        print(
            '-----------------------------------------------------------------'
        )
        print('\n')
        print("golden-eagle_version: " + ga.__version__)

        # Guarantee of reliability.
        ga.compare_before_after(my_before, my_after)


# try ~ except ~ finally.
try:
    thread = Face()
    thread.run()
# Custom Exception, raise throw.
except ValueError as ext:
    print(ext)
    raise RuntimeError from None

# Once Exec.
finally:
    # GC collection.
    gc.collect()
```

- Add it to your unit test folder, for example create unit/facecompare.py.

‚Äª It is mainly intended to be used with CI such as GitHub Actions.
